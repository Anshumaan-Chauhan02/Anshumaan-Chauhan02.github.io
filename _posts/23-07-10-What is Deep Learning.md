Mostly all of us have heard about Deep Learning (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) from various sources. After the release of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), a Large Language Model (LLM) developed by [OpenAI], these fields have again gained a lot of attention from different areas such as Finance, Insurance and many others (if you don't know what an LLM is, no need to worry). Few years back, researchers in AI and ML promised that we will have self-driving cars, automated intelligent chatbots, and many advances that would help in automation and reduce human labor. If we track all those promises now, we can see [Tesla], [OpenAI], [Stability AI] and many such startups/companies that have successfully integrated the intelligent AI systems in our day-to-day usage applications. Before diving deep into how beneficial is deep learning, let's cover some basic and essential context. 

### Artificial Intelligence 
One thing that should be clear from the start is that ML and DL are subsets of the field AI.
