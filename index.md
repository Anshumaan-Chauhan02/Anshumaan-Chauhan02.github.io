Welcome to my personal website! I'm Anshumaan Chauhan üëã, a recent MS in Computer Science graudate üñ•Ô∏è from [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) üèõÔ∏è. I have a keen interest in Natural Language Processing and its practical applications, particularly in the exciting field of Text Generation. Additionally, I find myself drawn to exploring the practical aspects of Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning.

With a strong foundation in Python, I enjoy implementing various architectures using popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and Keras. I find  diving deep into cutting-edge research papers üìñ, experimenting with novel techniques üë®‚Äçüíª, and translating theoretical knowledge into practical solutions highly satisfactory.

I actively engage in staying updated with the latest advancements in the field of Deep Learning üß† as I believe that without keeping pace with such fast paced research industry, we won't be able to provide innovation for a better purpose. 

Through this website, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and projects related to my areas of interest. I also plan to start writing some blogs about projects and researchers that excites me the most ‚úçÔ∏è. Feel free to explore my portfolio and discover the projects I have undertaken, showcasing my proficiency in implementing state-of-the-art algorithms and solving real-world challenges.

I am always open to collaboration ü§ù and opportunities to work on exciting projects that push the boundaries of DL. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect ‚úâÔ∏è, please don't hesitate to reach out - <achauhan@umass.edu>.
