### Research üîé
I am currently interested and researching on the following topics pertaining to Deep Learning:
* Natural Language Processing
   * Multi-Modality Generation conditioned on Text
   * Efficient Model Training - stuff related to QLoRA, Adapters and Bit-Quantization
   * Easy Large Model Deployment for Public Inference
* Computer Vision
   * Visual Transformers
   * Image Generation
   * Scene/Image Transformation conditioned on Text   

### Publications üìù
* Constraint-Based Multi-organ Identification in CT Images using Unsupervised Learning
* [Toward Generating System Architecture and Formal Functional Description in the Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL) with Structured Natural Language](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-abstract/IDETC-CIE2022/86212/V002T02A077/1150294)
* [LPRNet: A Novel Approach for Novelty Detection in Networking Packets](https://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=13&Issue=2&Code=IJACSA&SerialNo=13)
* [Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms and Feature Extraction Methods for Sentiment Analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9633882)
* [Genetic Algorithm and Ensemble Learning Aided Text Classification using Support Vector Machines](https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume12No8/Paper_30-Genetic_Algorithm_and_Ensemble_Learning_Aided.pdf)

Please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xjb7cRcAAAAJ&hl=en) for more details about the publications I have been a part of.
