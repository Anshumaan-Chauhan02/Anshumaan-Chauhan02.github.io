### Research
I am currently interested and researching on the following topics pertaining to Deep Learning:
* Natural Language Processing
   * Multi-Modality Generation conditioned on Text
   * Efficient Model Training - stuff related to QLoRA, Adapters and Bit-Quantization
   * Easy Large Model Deployment for Public Inference
* Computer Vision
   * Visual Transformers
   * Image Generation
   * Scene/Image Transformation conditioned on Text   

### Publications
* Constraint-Based Multi-organ Identification in CT Images using Unsupervised Learning
* Toward Generating System Architecture and Formal Functional Description in the Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL) with Structured Natural Language
* LPRNet: A Novel Approach for Novelty Detection in Networking Packets
* Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms and Feature Extraction Methods for Sentiment Analysis
* Genetic Algorithm and Ensemble Learning Aided Text Classification using Support Vector Machines

Please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xjb7cRcAAAAJ&hl=en) for more details about the publications I have been a part of.
